            <h1>Man's Best Friend</h1>
            <time datetime="01-05-2025">January 5, 2025</time>
            <p>
                My family had always politely waved to the elderly lady two houses down, but we’d never gone through the bother of an actual conversation. When she flagged down my mother and me one afternoon, the last thing I expected was an extraordinarily generous offer. She’d heard I’d just passed my driver’s test, she explained, and because she was about to splurge on a brand-new BMW for herself, she wanted to donate me her 1994 Buick LeSabre. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I couldn’t believe my luck. It was the summer before my senior year in high school, and the thought of rolling up to the fast-food drive-thru window in my own ride (even if it had a top speed best described as “chugging”) gave me a ridiculous surge of pride. Swiftly, euphorically, I rationalized the situation. A prehistoric four-door sedan from the first Clinton administration had little resale value.  After all, the lady had practically battered the thing against her trash cans so many times that the front-left corner looked like it had gone through a cheese grater. Her only choice, really, was to unload the heap onto some random teen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But when I trotted over to receive my new whip, she insisted I chip in for a recent battery replacement—an amount that perfectly equaled my entire stash of lawn-mowing money. I handed over the crumpled bills, feeling more than a little swindled. Still, the pull of having my very own car was irresistible, and I circled around to the driveway to finally inspect it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The formerly white exterior had yellowed over the years, settling on a color slightly darker than beige. Like all LeSabre’s, the gray leather seats resembled couches. They were miraculously clean, save for one splotchy maroon wine stain I discovered between the driver’s seat cushions. As I failed to scrub out the color, I thought of the scuffed exterior corner. Turning the key in the ignition, the engine revved up in two miraculous swells of noise, falling to a slow roar that vibrated under me. That growl deserved a royal title: I named it Mufasa.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Mufasa, majestic though he was, required fuel. Fuel required money. And I now had precisely zero of that, thanks to my neighbor’s “battery fee.” When my card got declined at the gas station and I had to shame-call my mom to bail me out, I knew my pride needed some serious financial backup. I needed a summer job.

                To start, I had a lifeguarding license from a previous stint at a community pool. Browsing “best lifeguarding jobs new york for teenager,” I came across Crestwood Country Day Camp, a small operation just fifteen minutes from my house. Their website screamed perfection: smiling kids, sunny lawns, no obvious lawsuits on display. Perfect. I pictured myself up on the lifeguard stand, whistle gleaming in the sun, shirt off, biceps (or what I had that sort of counted as biceps) on display. Maybe some cute counselors would notice me. Maybe I’d rescue a kid and become a legend of the pool deck – girls love a guy who can do mouth-to-mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interview was two weeks later, on a chilly day in May. Walking into the main office, I encountered a gaunt, white-haired man wearing a droopy white tank top with a peeling red “LIFEGUARD” decal, and a bright red bathing suit with an uncomfortably short inseam. My future boss.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If you see a kid drowning in the pool, what would you do?”
            </p>
            <p>
                I had barely started introducing myself. Gathering my composure, I gripped the armchair, shifting in my seat.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I would save them?” My voice trailed up at the end, as if I knew it was not the answer he wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wrong. You blow your whistle first.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I was miffed. Obviously, if I were on duty, I’d follow lifeguard protocol to alert the other lifeguards that I was conducting a save. But he’d given no context as to where I was! If I am walking on the street and I see some kid flailing about in the water, I won’t be looking around for a whistle.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So, what do you do for fun?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Kind of a one-eighty from Question #1. Confused if I somehow passed his test, I rehearsed the pre-written response I had drafted for every job interview. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He propped his bare feet on the desk and, eyes half-lidded, started rubbing his big toe knuckles, one by one, as if he were trying to summon a genie from his foot. I tried to keep my eyes on his face, but my vision kept darting downward, as if possessed. He noticed my horror and just grinned, cradling those toes like newborn kittens.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Go on.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “As I was saying,” I managed, “I read a lot… and I play piano.” My voice wobbled, as if the toes might be listening too.
            </p>
            <p>
                My eyes shot to his foot and back, and his eyes did the same. Shit. Was he onto me? This was normal to him — I didn’t want to be the weird one. Instead, I just asked for the contract. Maybe if I got hired, I could convince him socks existed.
            </p>
            <p>
                He shrugged. “Sure. Fifteen dollars an hour until August. Meals come out of your pay.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                I signed without hesitation. Fifteen an hour? I’d be swimming in cash. I pictured myself waltzing into the gas station, filling Mufasa’s tank without a second thought, maybe even scoring a cool pair of shades. This lifeguard gig was basically my ticket to manhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first day of camp, I showed up in full lifeguard attire, ready to sit back and soak in the sun. My dreams were quickly crushed when I tried to get onto the stand.
            </p>
            <p>
                My coworker pulled my shoulder. “We’re not allowed to sit on shift. Someone fell asleep two years ago, so now we have to stand up the entire time.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was ridiculous but doable. By lunch, I was famished. As I ate my chicken nuggets, I overheard a senior lifeguard explain the pay. Since they provided us with lunch, they could pay us less than minimum wage. I had known this but was surprised to learn the extent of their cut costs: instead of $15 an hour, I was making $2. I felt too sick to finish my meal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two weeks passed in a haze of chlorine and regret. Kids flailed around in the water like hyperactive penguins. I kept waiting for a magical moment: maybe a pretty camper’s older sister (or mom) would stroll by and be impressed by my whistle. But no dice. I felt like I was serving a sentence — soon enough, my colleagues were enacting prison rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sometimes, if a kid needs to be saved, I’ll let them drown for a couple extra seconds to teach them a lesson.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I got it – I was one chicken nugget away from doing the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my last day at Crestwood, a big thunderstorm passed, which meant the pool had to be closed. I was elated, as this presumably meant I had a day off. But I was stopped before I could make it to the locker room. My boss chided me for my stupidity — clearly, I had not considered the possibility of a child hopping the ten-foot fence in the pouring rain and drowning in the pool. Surely, no kid was that dedicated to drowning – I told him I’d take my chances. He told me to shut up.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I did: for the rest of the day, I stood at the edge of the pool, watching the rain’s ripples in the pool water, guarding nothing. My tank top clung to my skin, water streamed from my bathing suit onto my legs. Eight hours later, after cleaning the pool, I walked into his office, handed him my resignation letter, and left before he could take his shoes off.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started summer picturing myself as the coolest kid on the block – granny-car pimp, whistle god, girl magnet. Instead, I got swindled by an old lady, enslaved by a toe-massaging boss, and paid in chicken nuggets. Some other sucker could guard an empty pool in the rain. And maybe some other lucky teen would get to buy Mufasa – because I was done playing lifeguard with my dignity.
