            <h1>Bacon-egg-and-cheese</h1>

                I never expected to find the world’s greatest sandwich at a five-shop strip mall. I’d spent my childhood in New York City, the food capital of the world. But the year I turned twelve, I left my dad’s apartment and moved in with my mother into the significantly-less-tasty Syosset. It’s a wonder I even found it; Village Bagel is so unassuming that I’m surprised I didn’t miss it in the suburban blur of half-dressed window mannequins and blinking neon signs. But if you make the third left off Jackson Avenue, squeeze into a slightly-too-small parking space, open the squeaky glass door, and order a bacon-egg-and-cheese—said all at once, as if it’s one word, not four—you’ll be rewarded with a bite of heaven. Even better is when you peel back the burning-hot tinfoil and see the melted cheese still intact, like a bow. It smells delicious, obviously, but there’s something deeper if you let the scent linger long enough—bitter like cigarette smoke, salty like air from the subway. It’s as if the sandwich won’t let you forget the screeching trains and graffiti-stained walls of its genesis. For a moment, it reminds me of home.

                The day before I left for college, I drove to Village Bagel in search of this feeling. The smell of yeast seemed to permeate every surface; the bagels were fresh that day. I unconsciously quickened my pace as I made out the flavors displayed within the glass counter. Popular toppings included poppy seeds, onions, salt—if you were feeling especially gluttonous, an “everything” bagel had all of them. I was famished, and there was only one “everything” bagel left. I ran to the cashier before anyone else could take it.

                Contrary to popular business practices, Village Bagel revels in making the register as inaccessible as possible: to order, you must slip through densely packed plastic tables, squeeze between chairs to get a drink from the refrigerator, and somehow dodge two or three young kids playing catch with an unopened container of potato salad. Sometimes, an orange tabby cat loiters near the garbage can. I bumped into every possible obstacle as I navigated the course—even bagel connoisseurs have their limits.

                My dad taught me to love the bacon-egg-and-cheese. I grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens, where the breakfast sandwich was a city staple. Every Saturday morning, we’d walk along 37th Street to K&L Deli, a place my dad had gone to since he was a child. He was very particular about his order—for one, he preferred sausage to bacon (something about the “structural integrity” of the sandwich), and he only ordered cheddar cheese. We always brought back a buttered bagel for my sister, who never woke up early enough to catch the breakfast rush. Coming home, we ate our sandwiches on the fire escape overlooking the street. Cold air would rush through my hair as I opened the tinfoil; crumbs would fall between the grates down to the sidewalk below. I felt so large up there—I would lean over the banister and crush the perspective of people between my fingers.

                The summer before middle school, my dad lost his lease, and the three of us moved into a room in my aunt’s apartment. My sister and I shared an air mattress, and my dad slept on the couch—including my aunt and uncle, five of us fought to use the single bathroom. Money prevented our daily trips, so we made sandwiches at home. Some days I had to settle for ham, and I would make sure to let the entire family know the extent of this tragedy. I could still finesse my way into a bacon-egg-and-cheese with enough complaining, but my dad would never eat one, too. I assumed he just didn’t like the flavor anymore.

                One day, I invited a girl over for the first time. I couldn’t help but brag to all my friends about how pretty she was and how I was determined to get my first kiss before any of them. It was a Friday, so I could expect the family to be outside—perfect for my plan. But as we walked to the front door, I heard the familiar voices of my family talking. Embarrassed, I turned her away.

                I sat in the bathroom that night—the only place I could be alone. This was all my family’s fault: with everyone always surrounding me, there was no room for me to grow. I was so stifled by all of the noise, the footsteps, the feeling of four other people breathing down my neck. I told my dad I couldn’t stay here, that I would sooner sleep on the streets because at least I had space to roll over on the sidewalk. I knew he tried his best, but it couldn’t support the life I thought I needed. It was like settling for ham.

                I left the city to live with my mom shortly after, and quickly fell out of touch with my dad. Our phone calls dwindled, and each conversation became a mere formality. I love my dad, but a high schooler is never concerned with the lives of others. I immersed myself in my new routine, the more I felt like I was living in two worlds: one with my mom, full of the familiar comforts of home, and another where my dad was a distant figure, someone I adored but hardly knew anymore. I would scroll through my phone, tempted to call him, but something held me back. I chose a nice house over my own dad—what could I even say to him? Maybe I was worried he would forgive me.

                This absence is what led me to Village Bagel in the first place. I needed something that connected me to my past—a tangible taste of those moments on the fire escape. The slightly dirty interior was a start. The scratched tables and mismatched chairs felt familiar, too. There was even a cat roaming the floor, something I’d never seen outside of a bodega. Opening up my sandwich, I individually inspected each ingredient: the jammy egg yolk dripped down the face of the bagel, smoothing out the edges of a piece of crispy bacon. The bagel was un-toasted, as requested—good bagels need no alteration. There wasn’t enough cheese, but that could be fixed next time if I asked. If I tried hard enough, I could make this place my home.

                That morning before college, I sat alone in the car with my sandwich. There was a strange sense of finality to the process: I couldn’t stop thinking it was the last time I would repeat each action. I let each piece turn to mush in my mouth, afraid to let go of each flavor. It made the sandwich hard to enjoy. Eventually, I shoved down the final quarter—I had to rip the Band-Aid off. Sighing, I folded the wrapper and placed it in the brown paper bag. The next time I came to Village Bagel, I would be a visitor, a guest in a place that once felt like my only home. But for that moment, it was still mine.

                Now I live one hundred miles away in New Haven, Connecticut. I ordered a bacon-egg- and-cheese from Good Nature Market the other day, and couldn’t conjure my dad within the taste. I even got it with cheddar. I had a scary thought that maybe my order was not special at all, that it was just another sandwich. That all I loved about it was a fading sense of nostalgia. I fantasized about how much better it tasted back home, and come October break, it would be my first meal. Yet I was afraid to go back to Village Bagel. I preferred to keep it just like my dad: some distant, pleasant idea I would not come close to in fear of spoiling my memory of it. I walked to the Branford Courtyard and marveled at the way tree branches seemed to split rays of sun before they touched the grass. Today was as good a day as any. I picked up my phone to call my dad, and listened to the ring of the other line.
