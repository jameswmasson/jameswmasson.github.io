            <h1>A Tale of Two Males</h1>

                Presumably, most young men don’t aspire to someday become serial killers. But among man-o-sphere influencers and Twitter threads, Patrick Bateman, the anti-hero of Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho, has become a role model. Published in 1991, the novel chronicles the double life of Bateman, a wealthy Wall Street investment banker who spends his days securing reservations at elite NYC restaurants and obsessing over business cards—while secretly indulging in brutal acts of murder. Ellis intended to portray Bateman as a monster created by a world obsessed with status and appearance. However, in trying to critique the rampant yuppie-ism surrounding Wall Street, he unwittingly set the standard for a modern man.

                It’s easy to see Patrick Bateman’s appeal, if you’re willing to ignore the chainsaws. He’s tall, fit, loaded, and has complete control of his life, even if it sometimes involves murder. The movie adaptation provided an eerily perfect Christian Bale’s meme-able expressions. Add in the sharp suits and the slicked-back hair, and suddenly Bateman isn’t merely a monster – he’s a vibe.

                 In search of an explanation for this unlikely evolution, I discovered what I’ve come to consider a hypermasculine version of astrology. According to the male demimonde of pick-up artists, self-improvement influencers, and “alpha male coaches,” there are two groups of men: alphas and betas. Alphas are society’s winners — the tall, rich, dead-inside sort who glide through life without a care in the world — and betas are the rest of us schlubs, destined to grovel for our scraps. It’s a worldview so obviously shallow you almost must engage with it: resources are limited, competition is infinite, and if you’re not stepping on someone’s neck while wearing Prada loafers, you must not be trying.

                According to its believers, this dynamic comes from nature itself, derived from studies done on wild wolf populations in the 1950’s. Researchers found that among wolf packs, the pace was set by a single “alpha” wolf, with the “beta” wolves following behind. This pattern repeats across species — chimpanzees (our closest relative) have an eerily similar hierarchical structure. In theory, this should apply to us as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many interpretations of the alpha male’s human analogue, but all of them involve some degree of power over other men. Alphas get what they want because they take it — typically through force — with strength, ability, or social skills. Society rewards this mentality, with alphas gaining the admiration of both women and men. Patrick Bateman’s influence is especially pervasive – watch any Fast & Furious movie, crypto-bro conference, or political campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                While extreme, modern culture ascribes this dynamic to human interaction because it serves as a convenient solution to the frustrating unfairness of success. There are simply too many factors to explain how the big promotion, the dream life, or the dream girl always falls into the hands of another guy. The alpha/beta dichotomy allows us to condense every facet of their accomplishments into a black-and-white picture. It’s simple: there are alphas, and there are betas. Better hope you’re born with the right jawline. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is particularly comforting to young men who are insecure about their situations. Sure, they’re betas now, but the internet is brimming with alpha-male personalities to sell them hope. Influencers peddle good news: your Greek-letter caste is not set in stone. Armed with their workout plan, overpriced nutritional supplements, or dubious body-language courses, even the most pathetic beta can ascend to alpha-hood. Fifty dollars later, the women, money, and success will follow.

                This fixation on alpha status also reveals a deeper cultural anxiety about masculinity in the modern world. In a time when traditional gender roles are being questioned, and the very concept of what it means to "be a man" is up for debate, the alpha/beta hierarchy offers a simple, almost nostalgic solution. The alpha male is a relic of an idealized past, where power was clearly defined and easily attainable through strength, dominance, and control. Many young men latch onto this outdated notion of masculinity, hoping to reclaim a sense of purpose and direction in a society that no longer offers clear-cut answers. The rise of gurus guiding men to "alpha" status taps into this longing – offering a quick fix to a much deeper, existential struggle: how to navigate a world that no longer provides the same certainty about success, identity, and personal worth.

                The problem is this advice is hilariously wrong: alpha-male influencers play up a caricature of masculinity, presenting a cartoonish, often toxic version of what it means to "be a man." Articles claim to “see through the lies,” offering Tyler-Durden-esque commentary on society – critiquing consumerism while embodying hyper-masculine rebellion. As John Winters from <a href="https://masculinemindset.com/sigma-male/">masculinemindset.com</a> writes:

                Alpha-male influencers, concerned about alienating their potential audience, shift the blame for societal problems onto vague external forces rather than addressing their own contradictions. The irony is that these critiques of “mindless zombies” rarely offer anything more than paranoia about self-improvement. If the beta consumer is a zombie, Patrick Bateman represents the goal: an alpha who has transcended society’s expectations.
            </p>

                So, is murder the inevitable conclusion of alphadom? Biblically speaking, maybe. The Book of Genesis introduces the world’s first alpha showdown: Cain vs. Abel. Both brothers routinely make sacrifices to God, but when God starts preferring Abel’s offerings, Cain lures his brother to a field and kills him. It’s the ultimate alpha move: eliminate the competition. Patrick Bateman’s murder spree is just a modern-day retelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is lost on contemporary alpha-wannabes is the inherent contradiction of being an alpha. Alpha males thrive on projecting their confidence onto others — showing off Ferraris, Rolexes, and beautiful women. Yet the very impetus of becoming an alpha begins from worrying how others think of them. Alpha males’ inner loci of control are constantly at odds with the insecurity of another man being better. Is an alpha male someone who doesn’t need to care about other men, or one who needs to dominate any potential competitor? Who is the real alpha: Cain or Abel?
            </p>
            <p>
                The truth is, there is no set definition of an “alpha male.” This obsession persists only because it offers something easy: a shortcut to understanding why some people become successful and not others. But in trying so hard to be an alpha male, men risk becoming trapped by the ideals they hope to embody – measuring their worth by the approval of others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The absurdity of alpha-male culture becomes even clearer when you consider its fixation on aesthetics. From Bateman’s meticulously curated appearance to the Instagram-perfect lives of modern influencers, this archetype thrives on superficial markers of success. It’s no coincidence that the alpha ideal is dressed in tailored suits, flaunting luxury watches and fast cars. These symbols are supposed to signal power, yet they also reveal the emptiness of its concept – a power that depends entirely on outperforming others is no power at all. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Patrick Bateman’s world is one of hollow success. He’s fit and popular, but his internal life is empty. For all the tailored suits and reservations at Dorsia, Bateman is nothing more than a man consumed by the fear of being seen as less. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, we refuse to teach this lesson. Telling men to embrace who they are doesn’t sell nootropics or “coaching” sessions. It doesn’t build a brand. But the truth is, the most “alpha” thing anyone can do is opt out of the grift entirely. Forget the suit-clad caricatures and the gym-bro sermons. Be the kind of man who laughs in the face of their nonsense, not because you’re better, but because you’re busy being your own damn person.
