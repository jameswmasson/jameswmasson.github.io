            <h1>In the Driver's Seat</h1>
            <time datetime="09-18-24">September 18, 2024</time>
            <p>Though I am a born-and-bred New Yorker, I am certified to operate an ATV exclusively in the state of Utah. 
                There is a blue ID card with a much-younger photo of me hiding somewhere deep in storage as proof. 
                For those uninitiated, ATVs (All-Terrain Vehicles) are motorized vehicles designed to operate on four low-pressure tires, allowing them to drive on a variety of off-road environments. 
                They are especially useful when exploring the wilderness, as downed branches, leaves, and rocks make on-foot transport impractical. In a pinch, they serve as a quick escape from a bear. 
                But to a child, ATVs represented adventure. Behind the wheel, I could explore something wholly untamed—something I never got from the numbered grid of New York City. 
                So when twelve-year-old me found a summer program where I could drive an ATV throughout the Utah wilderness, I had to sign up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite my youthful exuberance, actually obtaining the necessary license tested my enthusiasm. The required online course spanned 40 hours of videos (which is 400 if you're twelve), culminating in a final exam including surprise webcam snapshots to make sure you could not cheat. I took the final alone in my underwear and left horrified that I gave my examiner too much to proctor. All these obstacles made me feel over-prepared before I had ever seen an ATV. I beat my dad in Mario Kart all the time—40 hours of teaching me something I already knew seemed useless. Nowadays, Utah agrees: modern ATVs drive similarly enough to cars that simply owning a driver’s license authorizes you to use one. I guess past drivers had to account for load balancing, the front differential, and other technical knowledge I promptly forgot as soon as I saw “You Passed” displayed on my iPad.

                I thought of green trees and rust-red striped cliffs throughout the six-hour flight to Phoenix. The gradient of city to forests outside stirred my imagination as I tried to conceptualize the wilderness—the buzz of cicadas, the sweetness of petrichor, the hot air coiling around my skin like a blanket. Climbing the towering rocks I always saw in the distance. The view from the top. I imagined I slipped on a rock, and the feeling of falling jolted me out of my daydream. The airplane seat felt like a prison.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fifty of us were crammed into a coach bus for a five-hour drive from Phoenix to the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, in the northeast corner of Utah's upper protrusion. I tried to distract myself from preteen gossip and my seat-mate's snoring by staring out of the window. I was shocked by how big everything was: tree trunks seemed wider than a city block, the walls of the Grand Canyon stretched taller than any skyscraper. I felt small—I had forgotten that my home, as grand as it felt, was a small fraction of the greater world.
            </p>
            <p>
                My new home was anything but grand. Three large wooden cabins awkwardly surrounded a small fire pit, with a bench or two dropped randomly to fill empty space. Boys, girls, and chaperones were sectioned off into separate cabins. Of course, any building housing twenty-five prepubescent boys quickly devolved into a PG-13 version of a frat-house. Inside the main room, every available square-inch of floor was covered by a mattress, the surface only broken up by one dusty table and a lamp. Red SOLO cups added variety to the decor, some still sticky with left-over apple juice. I slept alone in the basement, as the stagnant air above was suffocating. The spiders were much better roommates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first night, the self-appointed leader of our pack (who claimed, at thirteen, to be the “oldest”) stole a beer from the chaperone cabin. Gathering ourselves into a little circle, we sat on the mega-mattress-conglomerate, desperate to try alcohol for the first time. The cell phone flashlight illuminated the amber bottle of Michelob Ultra to “oohs” and “aahs” from the crowd; we were all ready to do something bad. Paul, a snotty kid from the Hamptons, chipped his tooth biting the cap off before pouring all of us two sips' worth. I assumed it would taste better than it actually was. I was far from alone—every boy around me was locked in a war of attrition to not make a face, as if cool twelve-year-olds drank heavily. Grossed out, I made a tactical retreat to my basement bunker.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next morning was ATV day. Our counselors led us to a miniature obstacle course where a short driving test was to take place. The owner of the program instructed us on the specifics. We were to drive with a chaperone, who would assign a rating: “A” for unrestricted driving, “B” for required supervision, and “F” for no driving.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You can lose a limb if your ATV flips,” he said, making a point to scare us. He paused to let that sink in. Then he asked anyone who hadn't gotten certified to raise their hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul's hand shot up, sheepishly. His tone immediately switched. “You'll be fine, just don't crash it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly, the 40 hours I wasted getting my license went from feeling useless to being useless. I was furious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got an “A”, of course, and was led to my group's ATV. The chassis was boxy, finished with a glossy red paint. Inside, our group of six fit snugly into two rows of peeling leather seats. There were no doors or windows—the sides were completely open. Engines purring, we drove in single file, like ducks crossing the street. Every so often we would pass a river, and all passengers would curl up as water flooded the base of the chassis. Cheering with excitement, I dipped my formerly-white sneakers into the cool water. Like all New Yorkers, I grew up learning the city was the greatest place in the world. But I saw the shadow of the distant mountains, the way the ground swirled into green, lilac, and dandelion. I was exactly where I belonged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our expedition led us beyond golden aspen trees to a row of three abandoned cabins. The beige wood paneling followed organic curves, white, modern furniture decorated the interior—it looked perfectly untouched, save the shattered lightbulb dangling from the spruce-wood ceiling. We were told these cabins were models of future sustainable housing from the 1990's, meant to inspire a movement of coexistence with nature. Now, they sat as rubble, reclaimed by the environment. It gave me a spooky feeling—some primeval fear of humanity's hubris that a twelve-year-old cannot describe.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we turned around to go back to camp, it was finally my turn behind the wheel. Paul drove the ATV in front of me. We came upon a clearing in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, and Paul immediately gunned the engine. Turning, his right wheel slipped beneath a branch, causing the vehicle to flip over itself as it rolled along the open plain. I slammed the breaks, lurching forward in my seat. My chaperone’s hand gripped my shoulder, squeezing tightly every time the ATV in front of us collided with the ground. Knuckles white, hands clutching the leather wheel, I made out four screaming voices. I gritted my teeth imagining how each of them would look missing an arm.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is funny how the brain stores these memories: I can feel myself in every moment leading up to the crash. But as soon as I picture any detail after, I can only get a feeling, like staring out of a foggy window. I remember the smell of blood gushing out of a girl’s broken nose, the sound of someone popping dislocated fingers into place. I remember how silent it was on the way back. I remember Paul, the only uninjured passenger, crying alone in the basement. He pleaded that it was not his fault, that he messed up the acceleration and brake pedals. I told him he should have taken the course. Disgusted, I pushed him out of the way—he was blocking my bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ran into the forest that night. Everyone was asleep—there was no comfort in that cabin. Scratching my legs on rocks and pines, I followed the path to the abandoned houses. The door creaked open as a squirrel scampered out into the surrounding woods. I turned around to follow him. Watching him slip through rocks and bushes, I felt a strange sense of dramatic irony: he had no idea what danger waited for him in the forest. The branches he climbed were loose, a hawk could swoop down at any moment. Maybe his end lied under the wheels of another Paul. But he made it home, depositing an acorn in a hollowed-out tree. Lucky him. I clenched my fists—for the first time, I wondered if there would be a journey I would not come home from. I sat down on the grass, and looked up. The stars were more beautiful than ever.
